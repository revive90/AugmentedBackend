"""
Module summary:
- Provides a thin wrapper around a pretrained DINOv2 vision transformer to convert image files into fixed-length embeddings.

Public API:
- class FeatureExtractor:
  - __init__(model_name=..., device=...):
      Loads the image processor and model by name, moves the model to the specified device (GPU if available, otherwise CPU), and sets evaluation mode.
  - extract(image_path) -> np.ndarray | None:
      Opens the image (RGB), preprocesses it, runs a forward pass without gradients, mean-pools the last hidden states to a single feature vector, and returns it as a NumPy array on CPU. Returns None and logs a warning if processing fails.

Notes:
- DEVICE is chosen automatically based on torch.cuda availability.
- Embeddings are suitable for similarity, retrieval, or downstream ML tasks.
- Expected input: path to an image file; Output: 1D NumPy array of size equal to the modelâ€™s hidden dimension.
